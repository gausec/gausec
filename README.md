#### About me
ðŸŒ¼ Iâ€™m currently working for the National Park Service on a variety of threatened and endangered species projects. 

ðŸ“Š Iâ€™m honing my skills in R using the `ggplot2` package and using bash shell scripting to process next-generation sequencing data for a [conservation genomics project](https://github.com/gausec/KingRailPopGen).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about occupancy and abundance modeling in R!

ðŸ“¬ Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carol-gause-26a49a15b/).

ðŸŒž Fun fact: I have a decade of outdoor/field work experience, spanning from the Rockies of western Wyoming to the Outer Banks of North Carolina.
